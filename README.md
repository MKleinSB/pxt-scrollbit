# scroll:bit

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pimoroni/pxt-scrollbit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pimoroni/pxt-scrollbit)

17x7 pixels of single-colour, brightness-controlled, message scrolling goodness!

This package adds support for the Pimoroni scroll:bit to makecode.microbit.org.

A scroll:bit is required to use this package, grab yours here: https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bit

To use this package, go to https://makecode.microbit.org/, click "Advanced" then "Add Package" and search for scroll:bit. 

## JavaScript Reference

scroll:bit has 119 pixels arranged in 17 columns and 7 rows, each pixel supports 255 levels of brightness although these are gamma-corrected to 183 possible values.

### Get the size of your scroll:bit

The blocks `cols` and `rows` return the width and height of scroll:bit in pixels respectively.

Use these in your loops and flow control to draw amazing things!

### Light a single pixel

Light a single pixel on scroll:bit. Note, you must call `show` to display your changes.

* `col` is the column, from 0-16
* `row` is the row, from 0-6
* `brightness` is the brightness, from 0-255

```
scrollbit.setPixel(col: number, row:number, brightness: number)
```

For example:

```
scrollbit.setPixel(5, 5, 255)
```

### Display your changes

When you've finished setting pixels and drawing text, you must call `show` to display your changes.

```
scrollbit.show()
```

### Clear the display

To clear the display, you can call `clear`, you must also call `show` if you want to display your changes.

```
scrollbit.clear()
scrollbit.show()
```

### Display a text string

To show a string of text on scroll:bit you should use `drawText`:

* `col` is the column, from 0-16
* `row` is the row, from 0-6
* `text` is the text you want to show
* `brightness` is the brightness, from 0-255

```
scrollbit.drawText(col: number, row:number, text: string, brightness: number)
```

For example:

```
scrollbit.drawText(0, 1, "Hello World", 128)
```

### Scroll a text string across the display

Since a long string of text wont fit on scroll:bit, you have to scroll it across the display.

You can do this manually with `drawText` and `measureText` but we've included a convinient function for you:

* `text` is the text you want to show
* `brightness` is the brightness, from 0-255
* `delay` (optional) is the time, in milliseconds, to delay each scroll step - a bigger number equals slower scrolling

```
scrollbit.scrollText(text: string, brightness: number, delay: number=50)
```

For example:

```
scrollbit.scrollText("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog!", 128)
```

Scrolling text is always vertically centered, starts off the right edge of the display, and scrolls across until it's gone.

### Draw a single character

If you just want to draw a single lett, you can use `drawChar`:

* `col` is the column, from 0-16
* `row` is the row, from 0-6
* `char` is the text you want to show
* `brightness` is the brightness, from 0-255

```
scrollbit.drawChar(col: number, row: number, char: string, brightness: number)
```

For example:

```
scrollbit.drawChar(1, 1, 'H', 128)
scrollbit.drawChar(7, 1, 'a', 128)
scrollbit.drawChar(12,1, 'i', 128)
```

### Measure a text string

It can be useful to know how long a string of text might be, in pixels, on scroll:bit. Use `measureText` to find out:

```
scrollbit.measureText(text: string)
```

For example:

```
let width: number = scrollbit.measureText("Hello World")
```

This will return a number of pixels corresponding to the length of the text as it's displayed on scroll:bit (using the built-in 5x5 micro:bit font).

### Icons & Arrows

You can use icons and arrows in your text, just place their name in curly brackets like so: `"Hello {Heart} World"` or: `"Boo! Went the {Ghost}"` or: `"{Heart}{SmallHeart}{Heart} Happy Birthday! {Heart}{SmallHeart}{Heart}"`

Here's a list of icons you can use:

* Heart
* SmallHeart
* Yes
* No
* Happy
* Sad
* Confused
* Angry
* Asleep
* Surprised
* Silly
* Fabulous
* Meh
* TShirt
* Rollerskate
